From August 2023 to May 2025, the Royal Palm Beach High School Utility Program &  
Internal UIX Dashboard project transformed student data management for the School District of Palm Beach  
County. This integrated system automates student data entry with 99% accuracy by instantly retrieving records  
upon scanning student IDs, leveraging a secure, dual-database search mechanism that first queries a locally  
encrypted dataset of over 2,500 students with role-based access before expanding to a district-wide database  
containing more than 180,000 records. Utilizing technologies such as the Access Database Engine (ACE), Firebase,  
App Script, and OAuth 2.0 authentication, the system ensures both robust performance and stringent data  
security. It further enhances operational efficiency by automating essential tasks like auto date filling, student  
ID error correction, online contracting, email confirmations, data backups, and scheduling Google Calendar invites. An  
intuitive XML-based user interface streamlines record scanning, retrieval, and verification—reducing training time and manual workload—while  
a responsive campus website, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and hosted on Google Sites,  
facilitates ongoing traffic monitoring and troubleshooting. Additionally, a secure photo database archives historical records and  
event images, and the implementation of OAuth 2.0 implicit grant flow safeguards sensitive files. Optimizing  
event operations from Homecoming ticket sales to fundraisers and grade-level competitions, this innovative project has  
earned both district and state-level recognitions, underscoring its impact on efficiency and excellence in school  
administration.
